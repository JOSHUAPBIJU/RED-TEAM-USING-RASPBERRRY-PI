# 🎯 **RedPi: Offensive Security Simulation**

## 🛡️ **Overview**

This project demonstrates a **controlled phishing simulation** using a Raspberry Pi as the attacker system and a Windows 11 machine as the target. The project showcases **red team tactics** to understand attacker methodologies and improve cybersecurity defenses. It includes key operations such as:
- Phishing campaigns
- Payload deployment
- Reverse engineering
- Command-and-control (C2) management

The project utilizes tools like **Postfix**, **Dovecot**, and **Roundcube** for simulating email-based phishing attacks and applies the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** to analyze each phase of the attack.
