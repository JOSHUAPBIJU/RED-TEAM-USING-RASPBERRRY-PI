RedPi: Offensive Security Simulation

Overview

This project demonstrates a controlled phishing simulation using a Raspberry Pi as the attacker system and a Windows 11 machine as the target. The project showcases red team tactics to understand attacker methodologies and improve cybersecurity defenses. It includes key operations such as phishing campaigns, payload deployment, reverse engineering, and command-and-control (C2) management.
